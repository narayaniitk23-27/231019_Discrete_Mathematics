for the Lex program I am not able to do it, I searched in ChatGPT, google as well as YT but unable to proceed further. So whatever I have done is uploaded.

Steps:-
1. Save the lex file in a folder
2. Open that folder and select path, type "cmd", run the file
  i. flex MyWork.l
  ii. gcc lex.yy.c -o a
  iii. a.exe
3. if it gives error for lines 35, 36, 37 and 38. Delete this lines, run it again.
